            <h2>Can machine learning algorithms create art?</h2>
            <p>
                The first challenge in answering this question is that "art" does not have a formally agreed-upon definition.
                For this discussion, I will use the definition provided by Ilya Chistiakov, a former art student I interviewed:
            </p>
            <p class="blockquote">
                "Art is reality channeled through temperament"
            </p>
            <p>
                This interpretation describes art in terms of its inputs (<b>reality</b>) and what goes into the output (<b>temperament</b>),
                which poses two questions that carry over nicely to concepts in machine learning.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="section" style="background-color: white">
            <h3>Can an algorithm fully experience (and respond to) reality?</h3>
            <p>
                Almost all network architectures perform very specific tasks using very specific data. On the other hand,
                human artists can experience all aspects of reality through sensory input, and can learn a continuum of
                skills for responding to them.
            </p>
            <p>
                The spontaneous inspirations that often drive art come from artists seeing some part of reality, thinking about
                it, and deciding to create something as a result. What they ultimately create can rely heavily on the inspiration or have nothing to do
                with it. It can be painted, sculpted, sketched, or carved. The artists might intend to convey the joy, sadness, indifference, or
                frustration the inspiration gave them.
                <br>
                None of this flexiblity is readily available in current machine learning architectures; it has to be intentionally programmed in.
                Even reinforcement models that experiment with environment-based optimization and neuroplasticity are designed to reach a
                manually-defined goal according to manually-defined standards.
            </p>
            <p><b>
                Until more advanced technology is available, an algorithm cannot fully experience, or respond to, reality. This significantly
                reduces its ability to make spontaneous decisions and respond to its environment when creating art.

            <h3>Can an algorithm have a temperament?</h3>
            <p>
                Due to differences in training strategy, architecture, and hyperparameters, algorithms can have their own “temperaments”, in a sense.
                However, most networks (classifiers, encoders, GANs, etc) are trained so that their outputs converge to a particular target,
                meaning their “temperaments” are rarely as varied as those in human artists.
            </p>
            <p>
                Human temperament is typically impacted by personal experiences and perspectives on life, which vary significantly from person to person.
                This makes the work of each artist "original" and interesting, since it conveys unique aspects of their individual character.
            </p>
            <p>
                An algorithm's "temperament", on the other hand, is entirely driven by the task it is designed to perform –
                The training process simply consists of adjusting parameters to minimize a cost function. This leaves no room for any real "individuality",
                and the outputs of a fully-trained model can usually be predicted in advance.
            </p>
            <p>
                Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are a slight exception to this rule, since their outputs are rarely identical to the training data.
                However, GANs are designed to produce the images that cannot be distinguished from those in the training set. So, while there is uniqueness
                in what they generate, "individuality" is still completely absent.
            </p>
            <p><b>
                Therefore, while algorithms can have something resembling a temperament,
                it does not contribute to the artistic process in the same that it does for humans.

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
            Because it cannot fully experience reality or develop meaningful temperaments, current machine learning technology seems unable to
            synthesize what Ilya would define as art. Future developments may change this, but the fact that computers can only work with discrete
            objects means that it would be hard for a network to learna continuum of skills. Whether or not they satisfy the philosophical
            requirements for true art, though, networks can certainly learn and apply artistic techniques. Existing abstract art is already
            very good at conveying concepts “in the mind’s eye”, and I think that imitating it with neural networks could allow for meaningful
            data visualization.
